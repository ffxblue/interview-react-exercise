# Nine Pairing Exercise

This is a React pairing exercise. You can check out the working version at [https://elastic-cray-4007a8.netlify.app/](https://elastic-cray-4007a8.netlify.app/).

Feel free to communicate with your partner about the code, your observations, your decisions, and potential solutions to the tasks below. You may also use the internet to look up documentation, StackOverflow, etc.

## Installation

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

or

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

## Tasks

You can complete the following tasks in any order, and don't feel like you need to complete them all in the time allowed.

* As a user, I like to be able to save my preferences (title, temperature and wind). How could this be achieved?
* As a user, I'd like to be able to refresh the weather with the click of a button. However, the weather API has rate limiting, after which an error is returned. What can we do to prevent this limit being exceeded?
* As a developer, I'm interested in adding observability to make developers' lives easier and product managers happy. What application and audience observability would be valuable?

### Bonus task

* As a developer, I would like to optimise the application to improve code reusability.

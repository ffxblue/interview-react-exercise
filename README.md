# Nine Pairing Exercise

Feel free to communicate with your partner about the code, your observations, your decisions, and potential solutions to the tasks below. You may also use the internet to look up documentation, StackOverflow, etc.

You are not require to write fully functional code, pseudo code is acceptable.

## Tasks

- As a user, I like to be able to save my preferences (title, temperature and wind). How could this be achieved?

- As a user, I'd like to be able to refresh the weather with the click of a button. However, the weather API has rate limiting, after which an error is returned. What can we do to prevent this limit being exceeded?

- As a developer, I would like to optimise the application to improve code reusability.

### Bonus task

- As a developer, I'm interested in adding observability to make developers' lives easier and product managers happy. What application and audience observability would be valuable?
